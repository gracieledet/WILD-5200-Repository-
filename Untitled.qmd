where r is the radius.

Type the following code in the executable cell - make sure you do not change anything.

{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

This is the Epidemiological Triad consists of three parts, the Host, Pathogen, and Environment. This triangle shows how health problems and infectious diseases are spread. The host is the organism that has the disease. The environment has the external factors that can lead to possible disease spread. Finally, the pathogen is the microbe or agent that can cause disease.
