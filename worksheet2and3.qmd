This is the Epidemiological Triad consists of three parts, the Host, Pathogen, and Environment. This triangle shows how health problems and infectious diseases are spread. The host is the organism that has the disease. The environment has the external factors that can lead to possible disease spread. Finally, the pathogen is the microbe or agent that can cause disease.

Type the questions and your answers in the quarto document you have created. You can insert the table in your Quarto document. Available in the audiseco repository on Github. Link: https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/blob/main/ss_table.png
Please upload your quarto document to your Github repository after completing this worksheet.

1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.
Sample Size necessary: 59 deer 

2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios: 
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population
In a large population (Infinite), a sample size of 299 would be needed for detecting disease at 1% prevalence and 95% Confidence. 
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population
In a large population (Infinte), a sample size of 229 would be needed to detect disease at a 2% prevalence and 99% Confidence level. 

3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is __<___ (<, =, >) __1__%.
Population size: 4000
Sample size: 300
Confidence level: 95%
Number of positive cases detected: 0
95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is <1% because a sample size of 288 has a 1% prevalence 



4) An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and Russell counties). 
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county. Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.
Chambers: Prevalence = 8/30 = 0.267 or 26.7% at a 95% Confidence Interval 

Lee: Prevalence = 30/150 = 0.200 or 20% at a 95% Confidence Interval 

Russel: Prevalence = 3/96 = 0.031 or 3.1 % at a 95% Confidence Interval 

b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test.
Fisher’s Exact Test Results: 

Confirms (a) → Each Prevalence 

The sampling data is available in the audiseco repository on Github. You can import the data in your R Notebook using the links provided here:

5) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish. She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:
Day 1:		3 fish infected
Day 2: 	4 fish infected
Day 3:		7 fish infected
Day 4:		11 fish infected
Day 5:		20 fish infected

Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish in the pond (including previously infected fish). 
a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.       
PrevALLence: ALL cases/population total
INcidence: New cases/population at risk
Day 1: 
New cases: 3 
Population at risk: 60 (there were none infected on day 1) 
INcidence: New cases/population at risk → 3/60 = 0.05 x 100 = 5 cases per 100 fish per day 
Day 2: 
New cases: (4 total - 3 already infected) = 1
Population at risk: 60 (there were none infected on day 1) - 3 (already infected) = 57
INcidence: New cases/population at risk → 1/57 = 0.0175 x 100 = 1.75 cases per 100 fish per day
Day 5: 
New cases: (20 total - 11 already infected) = 9 
Population at risk: 60 (there were none infected on day 1) - 11 infected = 49 at risk 
INcidence: New cases/population at risk → 9/49 = 0.1837 x 100 = 18.37 cases per 100 fish per day 

b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?                                    
PrevALLence: ALL cases/population total 
Day 3: 
All cases: 7
Population: 60 
7/60 = 0.1167 x 100 = 11.67 % prevalence 
Day 5: 
All cases: 20 
Population: 60 
20/60 = 0.3333 x 100 = 33.33 % prevalence 

c) On which day is the prevalence the same as the incidence (except the units)?  
On day one, the prevalence and incidence are the same
Prevalence: 3/60 = 0.05 
Incidence: 3/60 = 0.05

Subject: How disease models can contribute to better wildlife disease management strategies
Date: 3 October 2024 

Ensuring effective wildlife disease managaement strategies is extremely crucial for many reasons, specifically preventing zoonotic disease outbreaks, preserving the enviornment and ecosystem, and promoting biodiversity. Disease models have been proved as an effective strategy for wildlife disease management because they provide insights into diseases that can help scientist predict outcomes and form intervention strategies. While disease models are beneficial, Starfield’s 'A Pragmatic Approach to Modeling for Wildlife Management' offers a practical and sensible approach to disease models as ‘truth’ and as probelm-solving tools. This memo will reflect on the limitations of disease models, including data uncertainty and ecological complexity, while also acknowledging how models can be used with other problem-solving tools to improve wildlife disease management outcomes. 

Disease Models and Wildlife Management 
Disease models are tools used in wildlife management that help to understand and predict different disease processes; they also help to form intervention and prevention measures. Disease models can predict disease patterns becuase they use certain factors such as population density, species behavior, environmental conditions, and pathogen characteristics to collect data. As long as disease models are used as a problem-solving tool, and not a complete accurate predictor, they have many benefits and provide an immense amount of data that otherwise may have been impossible to collect and analyze. 

Using disease models are beneficial to wildlife and zoonotic disease specialists. These models can provide data on how a pathogen spreads and what may be the potential consequences and outcomes of a disease. Knowing the prediction of how a zoonotic disease will act can help scientist implement preventative measures and also ensure more emergency preparedness. 

Limitations to Disease Models and Wildlife Management 
The primary downfall of disease models in accoradnce to wildlife management is that they are not always fully accurate. Disease models serve as a predictive problem-solving tool, not a definitive one. The dangers of referencing disease models is that some people can become too dependent on them; these people need to be informed that the models are predictions, not certainties for the future. 

Starfield highlights the danger of viewing disease models as representations of “truth” rather than problem-solving tools. If people rely solely on models, they can end up making flawed-decisions. Wildlife management professionals have to be remininded that disease models are simplifications of predictions and should only be used as one tool, alongside others, to make a decision. 

Disease models with other problem-solving tools 
As previously stated, disease models should be used alongside other tools in order to ensure accurate decision making. Field surveillance and monitoring is one tool that disease models could be used with. Ongoing surveillance and monitoring will most likely have a lot more data that can be used in reference and comparison to the disease models. Risk assesment tools could also be another good reference to use with disease models. When problem-solving tools are used alongside and comparative to one another, there is a lot higher of a chance for accurate data representation and information. 

Conclusion 
In conclusion, disease models are a beneficial tool for wildlife management. Although disease models can help with predictions and interventions, they should not be relied on as a definitive problem-solving tool. A tool such as this, should be used alongside other problem-solving tools to ensure accurate data representation. Disease models need to be looked at as a problem-solving tool not a ‘truth’.

Write a brief (1-2 paragraphs) report on the fecal floatation lab.
The fecal flotation lab was a lot more interesting than I anticipated. The steps were as follows: collect the sample, weigh some of the samples out, mix with water and solution, then put in a slide and let sit until it was time to be viewed. The goal of this lab was to detect any parasitic eggs in the fecal matter. For this lab, we used a sample from dairy cows, but typically, there are more eggs present in sheep or goats.  
Although our sample, unfortunately, did not present evidence of parasitic eggs, we could look and observe other examples and images of fecal flotations, specifically from goats and sheep, showing parasitic egg presence. The researcher made sure to inform us beforehand that the dairy cow samples we were using tended not to present eggs, but she did find a couple in some samples. The most challenging part of the lab was shaking the sample up with the solution and placing it in the smaller tube. Everything else was relatively easy; I just wanted to ensure nothing floated to the bottom, and everything stayed mixed up. 


Worksheet 6: 
The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of today, 65 cases of Marburg virus infection have been documented, and most of the people infected are healthcare workers, mainly those who work in intensive care units. ​

​1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.
Because the first person to get infected with Marburg most likely went to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoirs of the Marburg virus, a spillover event would be indicated. A spillover event is when a disease transmits from animal reservoirs to humans, such as a bat/human interaction. However, since 65 cases of Marburg have been documented, most likely from human-to-human transmission, it seems to have evolved into an emerging infectious disease. An emerging infectious disease (EID) is a human-to-human transmission that has gone beyond just a spillover event, as indicated in this scenario because healthcare workers are getting sick. Since the spillover from humans to animals has evolved into human-to-human transmission, Marburg should be classified as an EID. 

2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?
It is crucial to empower the community with knowledge about the Marburg virus and its transmission. This includes educating them about the risks associated with visiting caves and interacting with bats and raising awareness about the early signs and symptoms of the virus. By doing so, we can significantly reduce the risk of community transmission. 

Given the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of Marburg in healthcare settings, it is essential to ensure the safety of healthcare workers. This involves not only providing them with proper PPE, but also emphasizing the importance of waste and disposal management, isolation of infected patients, and regular screening of those who come into contact with infected patients. These measures are crucial for the safety and protection of healthcare workers, especially those working in intensive care units with Marburg patients. 



Exam 1: Question 11 

R0 represents the average number of secondary infections from an infectious individual to a fully suceptible population 
R0 = total number of transmissions/number of infectious individuals 

Scenario 1: 

total transmissions: 10 
infectious individuals: 5 
r0= 10/5 = 2 
R0 = 2 
Because R0>1, scenario 1 indicates outbreak growth. R0=2 means that on average, each infectious individual causes 2 new infections. 
High R0 values require hugher immunity levels to mitigate disease spread. 


Scenario 2: 

total transmissions: 10 
infectious individuals: 5 
r0= 10/5 = 2 
R0 = 2 
because R0>1, scenario 2 indicates outbreak growth similar to scenario 1. On average, every infectious individuals causes 2 new infections.
