This is the Epidemiological Triad consists of three parts, the Host, Pathogen, and Environment. This triangle shows how health problems and infectious diseases are spread. The host is the organism that has the disease. The environment has the external factors that can lead to possible disease spread. Finally, the pathogen is the microbe or agent that can cause disease.

Type the questions and your answers in the quarto document you have created. You can insert the table in your Quarto document. Available in the audiseco repository on Github. Link: https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/blob/main/ss_table.png
Please upload your quarto document to your Github repository after completing this worksheet.

1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.
Sample Size necessary: 59 deer 

2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios: 
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population
In a large population (Infinite), a sample size of 299 would be needed for detecting disease at 1% prevalence and 95% Confidence. 
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population
In a large population (Infinte), a sample size of 229 would be needed to detect disease at a 2% prevalence and 99% Confidence level. 

3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is __<___ (<, =, >) __1__%.
Population size: 4000
Sample size: 300
Confidence level: 95%
Number of positive cases detected: 0
95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is <1% because a sample size of 288 has a 1% prevalence 



4) An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and Russell counties). 
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county. Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.
Chambers: Prevalence = 8/30 = 0.267 or 26.7% at a 95% Confidence Interval 

Lee: Prevalence = 30/150 = 0.200 or 20% at a 95% Confidence Interval 

Russel: Prevalence = 3/96 = 0.031 or 3.1 % at a 95% Confidence Interval 

b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test.
Fisher’s Exact Test Results: 

Confirms (a) → Each Prevalence 

The sampling data is available in the audiseco repository on Github. You can import the data in your R Notebook using the links provided here: 
Lee County: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Lee.csv
Chambers County: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Chambers.csv
Russell County: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Russell.csv

Use Quantitative Parasitology (QPweb) for calculating confidence intervals and comparing prevalences: http://www.zoologia.hu/qp/qp.html

5) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish. She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:
Day 1:		3 fish infected
Day 2: 	4 fish infected
Day 3:		7 fish infected
Day 4:		11 fish infected
Day 5:		20 fish infected

Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish in the pond (including previously infected fish). 
a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.       
PrevALLence: ALL cases/population total
INcidence: New cases/population at risk
Day 1: 
New cases: 3 
Population at risk: 60 (there were none infected on day 1) 
INcidence: New cases/population at risk → 3/60 = 0.05 x 100 = 5 cases per 100 fish per day 
Day 2: 
New cases: (4 total - 3 already infected) = 1
Population at risk: 60 (there were none infected on day 1) - 3 (already infected) = 57
INcidence: New cases/population at risk → 1/57 = 0.0175 x 100 = 1.75 cases per 100 fish per day
Day 5: 
New cases: (20 total - 11 already infected) = 9 
Population at risk: 60 (there were none infected on day 1) - 11 infected = 49 at risk 
INcidence: New cases/population at risk → 9/49 = 0.1837 x 100 = 18.37 cases per 100 fish per day 

b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?                                    
PrevALLence: ALL cases/population total 
Day 3: 
All cases: 7
Population: 60 
7/60 = 0.1167 x 100 = 11.67 % prevalence 
Day 5: 
All cases: 20 
Population: 60 
20/60 = 0.3333 x 100 = 33.33 % prevalence 

c) On which day is the prevalence the same as the incidence (except the units)?  
On day one, the prevalence and incidence are the same
Prevalence: 3/60 = 0.05 
Incidence: 3/60 = 0.05
